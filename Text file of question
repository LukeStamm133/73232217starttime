Dear Staff and Peers,

I am stuck on the first part of the final project, where you have to load the data from .csv files into a pandas dataframe in Python and then connect to the database to write the queries.  I do not understand how to get the files I downloaded on my computer into Jupyter Notebooks.  My code looks like this:

import pandas

pandas.read_csv('"'C:\Users\live4\Downloads\ChicagoCensusData.csv'"')

df.to_sql("ChicagoCensusData", con, if_exists='replace', index=False,method="multi")

It is very frustrating because I know how to write the SQL queries required for the questions, but I do not believe a connection is being established to FinalDB.db, as I do not get a message saying I am connected, but rather keep getting all different kinds of errors.  I would be very grateful if someone could help guide me in the right direction, because I don't understand what I am doing wrong.  Thank you!!!
Wouldn't I need the details, like database name, and a password, to make an SSH connection to the database?  It is just this connection issue that has me stumped, not the SQL itself.  

Kind Regards,

 

Luke Stamm
